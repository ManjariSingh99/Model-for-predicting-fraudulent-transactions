# Model-for-predicting-fraudulent-transactions
In this project, I developed a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and used insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns. I used both Random Forest and Decision Tree methods to develop the machine learning model. Following usual model development procedures, the model is estimated on the calibration data and tested on the validation data.
